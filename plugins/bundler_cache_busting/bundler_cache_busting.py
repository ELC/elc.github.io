Bundler and Cache Busting
-------------------------

The bundler plugin generates a bundle file for all the css files and a bundle 
file for all the js files. It simply concatenates without minifing or 
compressing. Useful for reducing the number of requests without any 
performance overhead. It also modifies the base theme HTML file and appends
a hash of the file at the end to improve change detection when using cache 
systems or service workers.

It works with no no dependencies apart from pelican itself.
