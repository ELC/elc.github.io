<p>The single most requested feature for Jupyter Notebooks/Lab was live
collaboration <em>á la Google Docs</em>. Today, this is possible but should be done
with caution, since it gives access to the whole internet to run any (including
malicious) code on our local PC. This is a quick guide to prevent this by
implementing several layers of security.</p>


<h2 id="collaborative-notebooks"><a class="toclink" href="#collaborative-notebooks">Collaborative Notebooks</a></h2>
<p>There are many ways to work collaboratively, however not all are suitable for
every scenario. In the case of Jupyter Notebooks, there are three main types of
collaboration, the last of which has been introduced recently.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Asincronous Multiuser</strong>: each party makes changes and then changes are
  merged. This is git-like collaboration and is possible with Jupyter Notebooks
  out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>Non-Concurrent Multiuser</strong>: Several users make changes at the same time but
  not in the same files. This is currently possible when using Jupyter-Hub (or
  MyBinder) servers. There might be synchronization issues if modifying the
  same file.</li>
<li><strong>Concurrent Multiuser</strong>: Several users make changes at the same time in any
  document (even the same one) and the changes are merged without overlapping.
  This is the Google Docs style and is the new feature of Jupyter. Hereafter
  this is the type of collaboration that will be referred to as <strong>live
  collaboration</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-should-we-work-collaboratively"><a class="toclink" href="#why-should-we-work-collaboratively">Why should we work collaboratively?</a></h2>
<p>Working collaboratively has definite some advantages, one way to show them is
by some example use cases that would not be possible without this feature:</p>
<ul>
<li>A teacher can invite their students to actively collaborate on a notebook and
  write comments and questions in a centralized way.</li>
<li>A small team can leverage a server (or powerful computer) to run the
  notebooks instead of each having to run the kernels on their local PCs.</li>
<li>Two team members can work in different parts of the same problem, like
  hyperparameter tuning and data visualization concurrently.</li>
<li>A presenter can invite a small audience to try some Jupyter app (e.g. built
  with widgets) and have them use it with zero-install.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, this is probably not the best solution for all possible scenarios
but for small teams, mentoring / teaching and showing proof of concepts, it
might be worthwhile.</p>
<p>The results are illustrated in the following video</p>

<h2 id="risks-involved"><a class="toclink" href="#risks-involved">Risks involved</a></h2>
<p>Before enabling live collaboration, it is important to understand the risks it
implies. Therefore three different use cases will be illustrated:</p>
<ol>
<li>Host a Jupyter Notebook on the local PC and work together with someone in
   the same local network (LAN or VPN)</li>
<li>Host a Jupyter Notebook on the local PC and work together with someone
   outside of the local network (any PC with internet access)</li>
<li>Host a Jupyter Notebook on a remote PC and work together with someone
   outside the local network</li>
</ol>
<p>The first is mostly secure (as long as the local network can be trusted).
However, when giving access to the whole internet (the second option), some
security measures should be taken. The third case is too vaguely described to
be explained in detail since the steps might change for servers behind a
reverse proxy, servers in the cloud, or servers on-premises, furthermore, some
servers require specific firewall changes. For on-home, on-premise servers
steps should be similar to what is described for the second case.</p>
<h2 id="quick-solution"><a class="toclink" href="#quick-solution">Quick Solution</a></h2>
<p>This article covers some of the technical details and implications of each of
the steps. It is recommended <strong>to read the full article</strong> but for those who
already had and/or want a quick solution, refer to the
<a href="#summary-quick-steps-to-follow">4-command-summary</a> at the end.</p>
<h2 id="important-disclaimer"><a class="toclink" href="#important-disclaimer"><span style="color:Crimson"><strong>Important Disclaimer</strong></span></a></h2>
<p>This article assumes you have full control of the PC you are going to use, I
highly recommend <strong>against</strong> using these guide on any company-owned hardware to
avoid introducing security risks and/or going against the company's policies.</p>
<p>Moreover, I am <strong>not</strong> a security expert so I strongly recommend the reader to
make their research and validate everything here written because fine
details might be overlooked.</p>
<p>Finally, take into consideration that this tutorial is <strong>OPENING A
BACKDOOR</strong> for your PC so, one can never have too many security measures. If
this makes you feel uneasy, do all your experiments inside a sandbox (like a
container or a virtual machine).</p>
<p>To further illustrate this, Ribaka Nazmara 
<a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-most-dangerous-Python-line-of-code/answer/Ribaka-Nazmara" target="_blank">showed in Quora</a>
some dangerous yet simple code a malicious user might run:</p>
<p>Fill up disk:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>

<p>Crash the system:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>

</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>From Python, one can even run processes in the background with the <code>subprocess</code>
module. These examples should illustrate why not using adequate security
measures might result in disastrous outcomes.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="toclink" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>This tutorial requires Jupyter Lab 3.1.0 or newer and NGrok (for the second use
case). </p>
<p>If ngrok is not installed, all the steps are explained in 
<a href="https://calmcode.io/ngrok/the-problem.html" target="_blank">this 5 minute tutorial</a> 
by CalmCode.</p>
<p>In the case of Jupyter Lab, the version required was <a href="https://pypi.org/project/jupyterlab/3.1.0/">released on the 27th of
July 2021</a> so if Jupyterlab was not
installed recently, an update will be needed.</p>
<p>To check your Jupyter Lab version simply run:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>jupyter lab --version
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<h3 id="jupyter-lab-update-instructions"><a class="toclink" href="#jupyter-lab-update-instructions">Jupyter Lab Update Instructions</a></h3>
<p>If using Anaconda, run:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>
<span class="normal">2</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>conda update anaconda
conda update jupyterlab
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>For traditional pip installations, run:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>pip install jupyterlab&gt;=3.1.0
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<h2 id="use-case-1-collaborative-work-inside-lan-or-vpn"><a class="toclink" href="#use-case-1-collaborative-work-inside-lan-or-vpn">Use Case 1: Collaborative work inside LAN or VPN</a></h2>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_1.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_1.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_1-thumbnail.png" width="826"></a></p>
<p>Once Jupyterlab 3.1.0 or newer is installed, it is possible to enable the
collaborative feature by running:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>jupyter lab --collaborative
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>This will create a normal session available at http://localhost:8888. However,
this URL is only accessible inside your local network. To access from another
device (PC or Mobile) one should replace the "localhost" with the <em>private IP
address</em>, also known as <em>internal IP</em>. The IP address is a network address and
is not attached to specific hardware (as the MAC address), which means that
each time the PC is turned on, it might have a different private IP.</p>
<p>To know your private IP simply run this command in a terminal</p>
<p>On Linux/Mac:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>ifconfig -a
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>On Windows:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>ipconfig
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>Private IPs are the ones following these formats:</p>
<ul>
<li>Class A: from 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255</li>
<li>Class B: from 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255</li>
<li>Class C: from 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255</li>
</ul>
<p>The "Default Gateway" IP is the one for your router or networking device
whereas the other one (Ethernet, IPv4, or similar) is the one of the PC.</p>
<p>For example, if the PC's IP address is 192.168.1.35 any person connected <strong>to
the same network</strong> could access the Jupyter session by navigating to the URL
http://192.168.1.35:8888 in the browser. <strong>Note</strong>: This required that the port
8888 is open in the firewall of the PC running Jupyter.</p>
<p>By default, Jupyter uses Token Authentication which is transparently applied
for the local PC, meaning that incoming connections from other PCs will be
rejected or they will be asked to provide a token.</p>
<p>Tokens are difficult to share and remember as they are long strings of
seemingly random text, that is why they will be replaced with a user-defined
password.</p>
<h3 id="first-layer-of-security-jupyter-password"><a class="toclink" href="#first-layer-of-security-jupyter-password">First Layer of Security: Jupyter Password</a></h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_2.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_2.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_2-thumbnail.png" width="826"></a></p>
<p>The Jupyter CLI provides a straightforward way to set a global password by
running:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span>
<span class="normal">2</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>jupyter lab --generate-config
jupyter lab password
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>The first command generates a default config file, if already run before, it
can be omitted. The second one will prompt the user to write a password and
then confirm it. <strong>Note</strong>: when writing the password, no characters (not even
"*") will be shown, this is done so that the number of characters of the
password is kept secret, this is common practice in Linux Systems but may be
new for some users.</p>
<p>Continuing the previous example, when a user from another PC enters the
http://localhost:8888, it can access by writing the pre-defined password.</p>
<p>If configured correctly, the next time Jupyter is run, it will prompt for the
password:</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_password.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_password.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_password-thumbnail.png" width="790"></a></p>
<p><strong>Technical Details</strong>: The password is stored as a hashed in the configuration
file, so it is not stored as plain-text anywhere in the system and is a global
setting for all Jupyter Lab sessions (Jupyter Notebook sessions are not
affected). </p>
<p><strong>Important Note</strong>: Always refer to the 
<a href="https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/public_server.html" target="_blank">Official Docs</a>
in case some of the information presented here changes.</p>
<h3 id="second-layer-of-security-local-tls-encryption"><a class="toclink" href="#second-layer-of-security-local-tls-encryption">Second Layer of Security: Local TLS Encryption</a></h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_3.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_3.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_3-thumbnail.png" width="826"></a></p>
<p>Even having configured a password, the connection is not encrypted, which means
that, inside the local network, the password travels as plain text through the
network and thus is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_insecure.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_insecure.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_insecure-thumbnail.png" width="488"></a></p>
<p>If you trust your VPN or local network, this step is <strong>optional</strong>.
Nevertheless, this is <strong>mandatory</strong> when using public networks (cafés,
airports, etc.).</p>
<p>To prevent this from happening, a protocol with encryption (like HTTPS) should
be used. HTTPS is the most common approach, it uses TLS encryption so all the
data sent between two nodes is encrypted, which of course includes the password
that would have otherwise traveled as plain text.</p>
<p>Explaining how certificates (the key component of TLS encryption) work is
beyond the scope of this article. Nonetheless, one can set up quite easily a
self-signed certificate, the browser will show a warning saying the connection
<em>might be insecure</em> but that is simply because the certificate does not come
from a <strong>Certificate Authority</strong>, a company that is trusted to emit valid and
trustworthy certificates. Instead, the certificate is emitted by the user in
the local PC is not suitable for any production environment but is more enough
for this use case.</p>
<p>To generate this certificate the simplest way is to use OpenSSL which is
already installed if using Anaconda. In case Anaconda is not installed, OpenSSL
should be installed independently. Using Anaconda is however the easiest way
for Windows users.</p>
<p>Once OpenSSL is installed, navigate to the folder where Jupyter will be started
and run:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout mykey.key -out mycert.pem
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: if the error: "Can't open {some_path}ssl/openssl.cnf for reading, No
such file or directory" is thrown, see the next section to configure it using
Anaconda.</p>
<p>Once run, it will generate two files, the mykey.key, and the mycert.pem, <strong>none
of which should be added to source control</strong>. These two files will enable the
Jupyter server to use HTTPS for its connections, to do so, run the following
command:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>jupyter lab --collaborative --certfile=mycert.pem --keyfile mykey.key
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>This setup should suffice but, the user should be instructed to use
https://localhost:8888 (with HTTPS) explicitly because there might not be an
automatic redirection to HTTPS if using HTTP. The browser might show a warning
as described earlier but this should be ignored and continue anyways.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_self_signed.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_self_signed.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_self_signed-thumbnail.png" width="1508"></a></p>
<p>To remove the browser warning one should add the local certificate to the
truststore, that, however, is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p>With the previous configuration the connection between the PC running Jupyter
and the other PC is encrypted, even inside the Local Network / VPN.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: so far, the whole connection is done through the local network and
should not be visible from outside, but in public networks, this might be
different. The good practice is to never trust a public network, with the
password and this connection encryption a <em>decent</em> level of security is
achieved for local connections / VPN <strong>only</strong>.</p>
<p>In the following sections, this will be expanded to cover users from other
networks (i.e. internet). Hence additional security measures should be taken.</p>
<h3 id="config-file-missing"><a class="toclink" href="#config-file-missing">Config file Missing</a></h3>
<p>The configuration file for OpenSSL is not configured by default therefore one
has to run:</p>

<h2 id="use-case-2-collaborative-work-outside-the-local-network"><a class="toclink" href="#use-case-2-collaborative-work-outside-the-local-network">Use Case 2: Collaborative work outside the local network</a></h2>
<p>It is not the most common to have multiple users in the same local network, for
those cases, one should establish a connection with someone through the
internet. By doing so, the local PC is open to <strong>anyone</strong> with enough knowledge
to hack and get themselves in.</p>
<p>There is no way to guarantee 100% that no one unintended will be granted
access, there are some measures one could take against though.</p>
<p>The first layer of security described above is a must, having at least
password-protection is the bare minimum when connecting through the internet.</p>
<p>Moreover, in this section, several additional layers of security will be
described and at the end, a quick summary will be given to help the reader get
started in as little time as possible.</p>
<p>To set up an open connection to our computer, ngrok is a good solution. After
installing it, and adding it to the Path, and providing the auth token, one can
simply open connections in a single command:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>ngrok http 8888
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>This command is enough to open the connection, and since our Jupyter
environment is password-protected, there is no immediate threat. And this
provides an additional layer of security out of the box: <strong>obscurity</strong>, which
will be explained further in the next section.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_http.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_http.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_http-thumbnail.png" width="1306"></a></p>
<p>However, if one navigates to the URL shown, a 403 Forbidden message will be
displayed:</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_forbidden.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_forbidden.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_forbidden-thumbnail.png" width="413"></a></p>
<p>This is a security measure from Jupyter, it forbids all non-local connections:</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_blocking.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_blocking.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/jupyter_blocking-thumbnail.png" width="1745"></a></p>
<p>To allow non-local connections the <code>ServerApp.allow_remote_access</code> should be
enabled. This can be done from the Jupyter Config file created with the
<code>--generate-config</code> command. Simply append this line to the end of the file:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code><span class="n">c</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">ServerApp</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">allow_remote_access</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">True</span>
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>Now after restarting the Jupyter instance, the URL provided by ngrok should be
accessible:</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_success.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_success.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_success-thumbnail.png" width="645"></a></p>
<h3 id="possible-error-failed-to-complete-tunnel-connection"><a class="toclink" href="#possible-error-failed-to-complete-tunnel-connection">Possible Error: Failed to complete tunnel connection</a></h3>
<p>If a message like the following is shown:</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/failed_tunnel.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/failed_tunnel.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/failed_tunnel-thumbnail.png" width="790"></a></p>
<p>This means that there is no service running at port 8888. This means that
Jupyter is either not running or is being served on another port.</p>
<h3 id="local-certificate"><a class="toclink" href="#local-certificate">Local Certificate</a></h3>
<p>By default, when using a port as the destination, ngrok will point to the HTTP
as in http://localhost. However, when using the second layer of security and
implementing local TLS the above command should be rewritten to explicitly
target https://localhost as follows:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>ngrok http https://localhost:8888
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_http_to_https.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_http_to_https.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_http_to_https-thumbnail.png" width="1373"></a></p>
<p>This is an optional extra step, only needed when the local network is not
trusted (e.g. public networks). This is <strong>mandatory</strong> when used in combination
with the second layer of security described earlier.</p>
<h3 id="third-layer-of-security-obscurity"><a class="toclink" href="#third-layer-of-security-obscurity">Third Layer of Security: Obscurity</a></h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_4.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_4.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_4-thumbnail.png" width="1026"></a></p>
<p>Ngrok will generate a pseudo-random sequence of characters for the URL of the
connection. One might think this is a disadvantage or a limited feature of the
free plan (since the paid plan support custom subdomains) but, having a
hard-to-guess sequence at the beginning is similar to a password, since both
parties should know it beforehand to establish the connection.</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>https://7b42-201-212-74-100.ngrok.io
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>Another advantage of this approach is that if a given URL is compromised, one
can simply re-run the ngrok command and get a new one with practically no
downtime.</p>
<p>The clear disadvantage is that this method will impede any long-lasting
communication mechanism with the involved users (e.g. email), and one should
fall back on instant messaging methods (e.g. chats, calls, etc.). Nonetheless,
if the computer running the Jupyter will be kept on for long periods (like a
server), this drawback can be neglected.</p>
<p>That being said, obscurity on its own is not a robust security measure, it will
not stand against deliberate malicious attacks but it constitutes a bare minimum
layer of confidentiality.</p>
<p>When inspecting the console output, one can see that ngrok actually does two
forwarding connections, one for the HTTP and the other for the HTTPS. For
reasons already explained, if an encrypted connection is needed (as it is here
because we will be sending credentials), the HTTPS should be enforced by
rejecting any incoming non-HTTPS connections. Ngrok facilitates this with a
simple flag as explained in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="fourth-layer-of-security-public-tls-encryption"><a class="toclink" href="#fourth-layer-of-security-public-tls-encryption">Fourth Layer of Security: Public TLS Encryption</a></h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_5.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_5.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_5-thumbnail.png" width="1026"></a></p>
<p>The second layer of security introduced self-signed certificates for the
connections inside the local network (LAN or VPN), ngrok supports TLS
encryption with certificates coming from a Certificate Authority (CA) as part
of the free plan. However, the default behavior is to allow both HTTP (without
certificates) and HTTPS (with certificates).</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_with_without.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_with_without.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_with_without-thumbnail.png" width="1296"></a></p>
<p>To enforce the use of HTTPS simply run:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>ngrok http -bind-tls=true 8888
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>The console output now shows only one forwarding connection from HTTPS and all
attempts to connect to HTTP will be forwarded to HTTPS.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_https_only.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_https_only.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_https_only-thumbnail.png" width="1310"></a></p>
<p>The main difference with the second layer of security is that ngrok uses a
certificate coming from a CA and hence the browser displays no warning
whatsoever, resulting in a smoother experience for the final user.</p>
<p>One limitation of the approach described so far is that the Jupyter password
is set globally for the local PC, and in case it is compromised, it may be
inconvenient to re-share the new password to all users. To mitigate this, it is
possible to generate a per-session username and password. This procedure is
explained in the next section.</p>
<h3 id="fifth-layer-of-security-http-password"><a class="toclink" href="#fifth-layer-of-security-http-password">Fifth Layer of Security: HTTP Password</a></h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_6.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_6.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_6-thumbnail.png" width="1026"></a></p>
<p>The HTTP protocol implements a basic authentication system via a
username-password combination. These two fields travel as plain text unless
the connection is encrypted (e.g. by using HTTPS), since the ngrok connection
is already configured to only accept HTTPS, the username and password will
travel through the internet encrypted.</p>
<p>The free plan of ngrok also includes support for this authentication method and
can be enabled by adding <code>username:password</code> to the command:</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>ngrok http -bind-tls=true -auth=&quot;any_username:sesion_password&quot; 8888
</code></pre></div></td></tr></table></div>

<p>These credentials will be asked upon connecting to the ngrok URL</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_basic_auth.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_basic_auth.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_basic_auth-thumbnail.png" width="603"></a></p>
<p>After introducing the correct credentials, the password for the Jupyter server
will be asked.</p>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_basic_auth_success.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="narrow b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_basic_auth_success.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/ngrok_basic_auth_success-thumbnail.png" width="528"></a></p>
<p>This has an unintended advantage and that is that all attempts to log in are
against Ngrok servers and not our Jupyter Server. Providing a somewhat basic
defense against DDoS attacks.</p>
<p>With everything done up to this point, there are several layers of defenses.
One of the things not done yet was filtering. There are several types of
filters one can implement, being the most common IP and MAC filtering. In the
next section, IP filtering is explained.</p>
<h3 id="sixth-layer-of-security-ip-whitelist"><a class="toclink" href="#sixth-layer-of-security-ip-whitelist">Sixth Layer of Security: IP Whitelist</a></h3>
<p><a class="gallery" href="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_7.png"><img alt="Ngrok HTTP" class="b-lazy" data-src="/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_7.png" src="https://elc.github.io/blog/images/jupyter-collaborative/network_diagram_7-thumbnail.png" width="1026"></a></p>
<p>Ngrok provides an IP Whitelist feature, this is feature is only supported in
the paid plans. Having the possibility to only allow certain IPs is useful as
long as the users connecting have static IP addresses and they indeed know
them.</p>
<p>The most common scenario is that a user does not know their IP address and
even if they do it is hard to track when those are dynamically assigned (as it
is with several ISPs).</p>
<p>In an enterprise setting, this is less convoluted since most PCs are connected
through a VPN, and the VPN usually has a range of public IP addresses, thus
whitelisting those makes the service only available for those in the company
network.</p>
<p>For more information regarding this, check the 
<a href="https://ngrok.com/docs#whitelist-manage" target="_blank">official docs</a>
of ngrok.</p>
<p>This article has described some of the possible security measures one can take
to securely connect to a Jupyter instance, the following sections will
summarize the content showed in quick steps and finally, some pitfalls will be
mentioned to avoid potential security risks.</p>
<h2 id="summary-quick-steps-to-follow"><a class="toclink" href="#summary-quick-steps-to-follow">Summary: Quick steps to follow</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-update-jupyter-lab"><a class="toclink" href="#1-update-jupyter-lab">1. <strong>Update Jupyter Lab</strong></a></h3>
<p>Update Jupyter Lab to a 3.1.0 o newer with:</p>

<h3 id="4-run-ngrok"><a class="toclink" href="#4-run-ngrok">4. <strong>Run Ngrok</strong></a></h3>
<p>Run Ngrok with HTTPS only and providing username and password credentials</p>
<div class="highlight "><table class="highlight table"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre><span class="normal">1</span></pre></div></td><td class="code"><div><pre><span></span><code>ngrok http -bind-tls=true -auth=&quot;any_username:sesion_password&quot; 8888

<p>To avoid manually writing this file every time, a config file can be used to
automate the process. Steps to follow are shown in this 
<a href="https://calmcode.io/ngrok/configuration.html" target="_blank">video</a>.</p>
<h3 id="5-share-with-users"><a class="toclink" href="#5-share-with-users">5. <strong>Share with users</strong></a></h3>
<p>Share the Jupyter password via a long-lasting communication mechanism (e.g.
email), then share the ngrok URL and the associated username and password via
some instant messaging (e.g. chat). For extra security use two different
methods for the URL and the username-password, like sharing the
username-password via a screen share and the URL via chat.</p>
<h3 id="6-work-together-with-live-collaboration"><a class="toclink" href="#6-work-together-with-live-collaboration">6. <strong>Work Together with Live Collaboration</strong></a></h3>
<p>Now everything is set up to work collaboratively.</p>
<h3 id="7-publish-your-work"><a class="toclink" href="#7-publish-your-work">7. <strong>Publish your work</strong></a></h3>
<p>Whenever the project is public, it is worth sharing. When working with Jupyter
Notebooks there are several ways to do it. In 
<a href="https://elc.github.io/posts/jupyter-publishing/" target="_blank">this survey</a> 
some of the most popular options are explained.</p>
<h2 id="common-pitfalls-and-questions"><a class="toclink" href="#common-pitfalls-and-questions">Common Pitfalls and Questions</a></h2>
<p>Everything has been configured and now the environment has at least some basic
security measures. However, there are some common pitfalls to be aware of.</p>
<h3 id="explicitly-ignore-your-sensitive-files-in-source-control"><a class="toclink" href="#explicitly-ignore-your-sensitive-files-in-source-control">Explicitly Ignore your sensitive files in source control</a></h3>
<p>When using source control (e.g. git), the <code>.pem</code> and <code>.key</code> should be ignored
as well as any pre-configuration files from ngrok and jupyter. Otherwise, the
credentials and certificates are compromised.</p>
<h3 id="choose-different-and-hard-to-crack-passwords"><a class="toclink" href="#choose-different-and-hard-to-crack-passwords">Choose different and hard-to-crack Passwords</a></h3>
<p>It is useless to use two passwords if those are not different from each other,
good passwords are easy to read, easy to remember, and hard to guess. Against
what might be popular on the internet, using phrases as passwords is quite
useful and effective.</p>
<p>Since the Jupyter password will be applied to all sessions, it should be
strong, preferably more than 16 characters long, whereas the Ngrok basic auth
could be something longer than 10 characters. </p>
<p>To check password security by using some <a href="https://howsecureismypassword.net/" target="_blank">service online</a></p>
<h3 id="unreasonable-trust-in-ngrok"><a class="toclink" href="#unreasonable-trust-in-ngrok">Unreasonable Trust in ngrok</a></h3>
<p>In this article, ngrok is assumed to be a trusted organization, however, there
are no particular reasons one should trust ngrok. This post was not sponsored
by them or any other company and using the approaches here described put an
amount of trust in a free service some might find uncomfortable.</p>
<p>For the typical user of Jupyter Notebooks, it is unlikely that the weakest
point in the security pipeline is ngrok but, for the conservative,
security-driven users, this is something to carefully evaluate.</p>
<p>Ngrok will have access to the basic auth and for them, the Jupyter password
will be visible so they will have backdoor access to your PC. However, to the
best of the author's knowledge, there are no issues reported as security
breaches from ngrok.</p>
<p>Another important point is that everything is built on the free plan from
ngrok, should they change the scope of the features of the free plan, some part
or all the procedure here describes might be obsolete. This is another
potential risk, because there is no guarantee the free service will stay free
as with the same features long-term.</p>
<h3 id="not-suitable-for-unlimited-connections"><a class="toclink" href="#not-suitable-for-unlimited-connections">Not suitable for unlimited connections</a></h3>
<p>Even being generous, the free plan has its limitations and the collaboration
features might be limited to a handful of users (probably not more than a
couple of dozens). The free plan will likely fail to support hundreds of users
as in live conferences, a MOOC, or similar events.</p>
<p>This approach is suitable for personal/hobbyist use or small teams (&lt; 10
people). So far there are no benchmarks available as to how many users
concurrently can be working using collaborative Jupyter Lab with ngrok.</p>
<h3 id="remember-no-system-is-100-secure"><a class="toclink" href="#remember-no-system-is-100-secure">Remember no system is 100% secure</a></h3>
<p>This is an approach, it only showcases one possible way of doing things and
there might be better and more secure ones. However, I consider this is a good
tradeoff between technical complexity and practicality.</p>
<p>As mentioned at the beginning, I am not a security expert and it is up to you
to double-check, all the information given and assess whether it is useful for
your particular scenario.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="toclink" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>The new collaborative feature of Jupyter Lab is out of beta and ready to be
used. Some security measures should be taken beforehand to avoid any potential
breaches or risks. After understanding the underlying concepts, the new
Jupyter Lab can be run and set up in just 2 commands.</p>

                <p class="article-related-post-body-description">Jupyter Notebooks are the lingua franca for Data Science. There is hardly any data scientist that has never used this IDE. However, in contrast to its popularity and usefulness, the process of sharing a Jupyter Notebook is not straightforward. This article presents a brief survey of the different publishing solutions available for personal and/or commercial projects.</p>

                <p class="article-related-post-body-description">After a lot of research on the internet, I found no practical tutorial explaining how to embed Jupyter Notebooks in Static Websites using only free technologies. I found a way to do it using Github Gists, MyBinder and NBInteract along with IPython Widgets and I want to share it so no one has to reinvent the wheel.</p>
