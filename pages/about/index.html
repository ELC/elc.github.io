    <h1>About</h1>

    
  </header>

  <section class="page-content">
    <p>My name is Ezequiel Leonardo Castaño, I'm a follower of Jesus and a senior engineering student and I decided to start this blog to show other people what I've learnt from the Bible while at the same time publish content mainly related to Engineering, Programming and Math.</p>
<p>There's been some debate about mixing personal and professional lives, I understand that the environment and the people are different (usually), but I'm a single person where this two areas are merged so expect both personal and professional articles.</p>
<h2 id="my-studies"><a class="toclink" href="#my-studies">My Studies</a></h2>
<p>I started studying engineering in 2015, this is my fifth year and I expect to finish my degree in 2020, the degree is translated as "Information Systems Engineering" which is a mix of Compute Science and Management. The idea is to be close to the non-developers while still be able to understand technical information.</p>
<p>I've learned loads of new things in the university, particularly to always try to see the big picture. My favourite subjects were those related with mathematical and statistical models such as Simulation, Machine Learning and Data Visualizations, I also have a big interest in Education and open source.</p>
<p>In the language field, I'm a native Spanish speaker, I studied English for 7 years achieving a C1 certification (Cambridge) and I also studied German. This August I'll be traveling to Germany to continue my studies for 6 months.</p>
<h2 id="my-research"><a class="toclink" href="#my-research">My research</a></h2>
<p>Universities have a curriculum, each course has a syllabus but maybe what the student needs in the "real world" is not there. When I realize this, I started to learn on my own (although I was always a self-learner), reading books, subscribing to Youtube channels, newsletters and so on. I discover a lot of things but what I'm most interested in is Data Science. I'm currently in several research groups at University, some of which are about Machine Learning and Deep Learning.</p>
<h2 id="my-lifestyle"><a class="toclink" href="#my-lifestyle">My Lifestyle</a></h2>
<p>As I said before I'm a theist, and particularly I believe in the Bible's God and that Jesus is the Messiah. That said, I don't think that one's belief is something that is said but rather something that is expressed in the way one lives.</p>
<p>Whether other people agree or not, I strongly defend that our believes determines our way of thinking (even for those who deny God's existence). Following Jesus is a choice I made and that changed my entire life, exactly as the Bible teaches it should be. Nothing like the cold and distant traditions most people think is "religion".</p>
<p>In case you don't know what christian faith is, I have a Youtube channel (skielcast) where you can search for videos or look for "William Lane Craig" or "Ravi Zacharias" they would explain it much better that I ever could.</p>
<p>My personal experience is the following: I realized I've sinned, sin is everything that deviates from the original purpose of God, whether they be thoughts, acts or words. God didn't want me to suffer for the consequence of my sin, which is eternal death, so He became human (Jesus) and gave his life for me in the cross, paying what I should have paid. He, even knowing that I was completely against His will, came, suffer and died so I could have a now restored relationship with God. How wouldn't I adore that merciful God? Now, in response to such a great act of love, I decide to surrender myself, to willingly become his servant.</p>
